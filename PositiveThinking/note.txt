Introduce yourself in 30 seconds:

Experience (years)
Technologies (React, HTML, CSS, etc.)
What you are good at
What you want to improve on and learn for the future

Free time (learning on Udemy, pet projects, etc.)
Communication skills / English --> and what is your objective, for example: "I'm also improving my English skills and I want to reach Upper-Intermediate level in the next 12 months by speaking with foreign coworkers on a daily basis"

"...so I'm very excited to be here today and learn more about your project, so thank you for meeting with me today."

Create a connection with the other person (2-way communication)

Smile
Ask questions

If the interviewer asks you: "Can you tell me about JavaScript?"

"JavaScript? Sure. I'm sure you know Java. /OR/ Do you know Java? They're both programming languages, but JS is used in the frontend..."

Summarize the questions (helps you to make sure you understand them):

Repeat the key words of the question
If you don't understand the question, ask to rephrase it:

"Can you rephrase the question?"
"Maybe you could ask the question in a different way? I'm not sure if I got it." 

"May I give an example?" ---> STAR method

Use examples when you can

STAR method

Situation (when, where: give some context / describe the situation)
Task (what was your responsibility?)
Action (what steps did you take?)
Result (what positive outcomes were there?) "The happy ending" of the story.

Lesson learned: summarize what you learned from the example & why it matters


Ask questions at the end about (for example):

the project
the team
any technologies the interviewer asks you about during the interview

Example: "You asked me about NodeJS a moment ago. I'm curious how you use it in the project. Could you tell me more how..."

Remember to thank the interviewer for his time in the end:

"Thank you very much for meeting with me. I really appreciate your time and hope I will have a chance to work on this project. Thank you."
